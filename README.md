# Fly Heaven

One notebook, [`fly-heaven.ipynb`](fly-heaven.ipynb), that reruns two MaleCNS v1.0 connectome experiments on this machine and checks them against their published results:

- **Fruitless** ([`experiments/fruitless`](experiments/fruitless)): does blocking mAL output unmask a P1 courtship-neuron response to candidate male cues?
- **Fly / Wirehead** ([`experiments/fly-wirehead`](experiments/fly-wirehead)): a full connectome watching insect Shorts, with an artificial drive on its PAM11 dopamine neurons.

Both use the same three MaleCNS source files, so the notebook downloads them once (~1.1 GB, checksum-verified) and links them into each project's layout. It calls each project's own simulation code without modifying it.

The [`fly-chess`](https://github.com/Aananda-giri/fly-chess) project — a small trainable "cortex"
grafted onto this same frozen connectome, playing chess — used to live in this repo and has since
moved to its own. Its earliest notebooks were built reusing this repo's `experiments/fruitless`
prepared graph; from V3 onward it downloads the connectome itself and needs no checkout of this
repo at all.

## Fly Heaven: a connectome-driven film

[`heaven/`](heaven/) presents the full 166,700-neuron MaleCNS v1.0 brain's
behavior in a continuous macro forest-floor film using the rigged BlenderKit
housefly. Feeding, grooming, escaping, courtship and mating are gated by real
annotated cell-type readouts; the environment, navigation, female agent and
visible poses are presentation or scripted world mechanics. See the continuous
film instructions below for the current asset and rendering pipeline.

**[`web/`](web/)** is a Three.js alternative to the Blender render pipeline
below: the same rigged BlenderKit housefly on a macro forest floor built in
code, where each fly is driven live by its own instance of the full connectome
(`web/server/fly_worker.py`) — see [`web/README.md`](web/README.md).
Live demo: https://demo.aanandagiri.com.np/fly-heaven/

The simulation can still be reproduced with `uv run python -m heaven.calibrate`
and `uv run python -m heaven.simulate --seconds 220 --out runs/fly-heaven/day1`.
Export a timeline for Blender using `uv run python -m heaven.blender.export_timeline`
followed by its `.parquet` path. Lesion comparisons (`--lesion MN9`, `P1`, `GF`,
or `DNg12`) remain available to verify the brain-to-behavior routes.

## Run the notebooks

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a C++17 compiler, and FFmpeg (plus yt-dlp if the fly-wirehead videos aren't downloaded yet).

```sh
uv sync
uv run jupyter lab fly-heaven.ipynb
```

Start Jupyter from this directory. Downloads and prepared graphs go to `data/`, and run outputs go to `runs/`; both are git-ignored.

## Continuous macro film

The Blender pipeline now uses Joachim Bornemann's **Housefly-Exotic Rigged**
(BlenderKit `1fd6b0b2-d5e4-457e-ad87-62f5002eef40`); see
[`assets/blenderkit-housefly/README.md`](assets/blenderkit-housefly/README.md) for
provenance and native rig mapping. It builds one connected forest floor and
replays the existing `final4` simulation chronologically, including travel and
quiet intervals. The default director no longer reorders or time-lapses events;
`--highlights` explicitly selects the previous edit.

```sh
PYTHONHOME=/usr PATH=/usr/bin:/bin blender --factory-startup -b --python heaven/blender/build_world.py
PYTHONHOME=/usr PATH=/usr/bin:/bin blender --factory-startup -b runs/fly-heaven/continuous/world.blend --python heaven/blender/animate.py -- runs/fly-heaven/final4/timeline.npz runs/fly-heaven/continuous/scene.blend
uv run python -m heaven.director runs/fly-heaven/final4/timeline.parquet runs/fly-heaven/continuous/edl.json
PYTHONHOME=/usr PATH=/usr/bin:/bin blender --factory-startup -b runs/fly-heaven/continuous/scene.blend --python heaven/blender/render.py -- continuous runs/fly-heaven/continuous/frames 1920 1080 64 CYCLES
uv run python -m heaven.overlay runs/fly-heaven/continuous/edl.json runs/fly-heaven/continuous/frames runs/fly-heaven/continuous/fly-heaven.mp4
```

For previewing, pass explicit frame ranges in place of `continuous`, lower the
resolution, and choose `BLENDER_EEVEE`. Always use a separate frames directory
when changing the scene or render settings: a scene checksum guards resumable
renders against stale images. The Cycles final uses OptiX on the local NVIDIA
GPU, adaptive sampling, denoising and a 2K render texture limit; original
source textures are preserved.

`heaven/blender/motion.py` handles interpolation and interrupted transitions
without importing Blender. State labels are held until their recorded onset;
continuous positions interpolate between samples. Gait phase follows travel
rather than neuronal firing rate; IK targets preserve stance contacts. Visual
courtship spacing prevents the simulation's coincident point agents from
interpenetrating, and mounting adds a blended height offset. These remain
illustrative motions, not biomechanical outputs of the connectome. The chosen
housefly is a visual proxy for the MaleCNS fruit-fly brain.

The current recording contains no GROOM or BASK events. Their poses can be
checked with diagnostic timelines but are not inserted into the continuous
film. Ground dressing uses a fixed random seed and clears recorded paths.

For a background final export with automatic encoding and frame-count validation:

```sh
nohup .venv/bin/python -m heaven.blender.finish_film > runs/fly-heaven/continuous/job.log 2>&1 &
```

`job.json` records rendering/encoding/completion or the failure reason;
`render.log` records progress. Restart the same command to resume an interrupted
render. A complete movie is written only after all 5,281 frames exist.
